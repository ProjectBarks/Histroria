# Historia
One of my very first Android apps ever. It depends on google location services to track historic locations nearby and present them in a organized fashion. 
### Motivation
Our motivation originated from our vivid interest in History, and Application Development. We strived to create an application that could combine the greatest of both Fields, in a simplistic manner. We were motivated to create an application that could easily educate any user about any area they wanted to learn about. We want users to be able to quench their thirst for historical knowledge easily, and effectively.
